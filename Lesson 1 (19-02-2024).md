`19/02/2024`

Orario lezioni:

- Lunedì (9:15-11:30)

- Venerdì (11:30-13:30)

sempre in aula 2.7A

Gli SRS si basano su cloud: argomenti e progetto saranno principalmente su quello.

2 tipi di esami:

- Tipo A = Entro fine luglio; progetto di gruppo su modello DevOps

- Tipo B = Orale (da settembre in poi)

3 date per il progetto (da definire): 15/06, 05/07, 21/07

TIPO A

Si possono proporre argomenti, ma devono essere definiti col prof. Membri dello stesso gruppo possono discutere il progetto in date differenti, ma solo per motivi particolari e la data di consegna è unica. Non ci si può unire a un gruppo dopo che si è definito il progetto.

Si consegna 24h prima.

Per il resto è tutto uguale a cyber.

Per motivi paricolari (es. Erasmus), si può anche fare presentazione online (max. 1 persona).

Non ufficialmente, si può fare anche a fine maggio (con le modalità viste con Cyber).

Attività progettuale:

Si può estendere il progetto come attività progettuale.

Può essere propedeutica al master, insieme ai lab di SRS e al progetto presentato all'esame. Ci saranno vari step, che verranno valutati man mano che l'attività prosegue. Peso: 4 CFU.

**MODERN SERVICES**


Modern services are **cloud-based** and **always available**. They're **distributed**, always accessible, and can manage multiple users/requests (**scalable**, because they work independently of the number of users). For example: Amazon, Twitch, Gmail, etc.

Another important characteristic is **usability**. The typical user doesn't care about how they work, and we don't have to show it to them. So, the complexity is masked to the common users (they provide **transparency**). These are mandatory requirements for developing a service.

From these services we must make a profit too.  (Remember: some might be apparently free, but you pay with data).

The real competition between these services is about **time** ( = number of **active users**).

Companies do not care about ethics, but profit! Ethics is related to a term which is **ESG** (Environment, Society, Government, the new trend of eastern world) .

**WE ARE BUILDING A CYBER PHYSICAL WORLD**

We are **connecting** people, data, etc. Those things are enhanced by a lot of **sensors** and **actuators**. We are increasing **self-automation** of smart objects. Smart objects are connected, next generation objects that **collect data**. Based on data they can **gain awareness** about the environment, people, etc. The next step is that they can **suggest behavior** based on the information collected. In the future they can be **autonomous**: they'll be able to take decisions with or without human supervision. Our task is to create trusted systems.


**WHAT'S IN A SERVICE?**


A service is the ability of a system (belonging to a **service provider**) of continuously delivering one or more responses in the presence of specific requests to the system by a customer (called **service requestor**).

Services have another important characteristic: **workload** àIt is mandatory to know the number of users to satisfy. It can be anticipated or experienced. Because we cannot dimension our systems regarding to their top workload (anticipate the workload costs too much), we need to develop SRS that work independently of the number of users.

So, what's in a service?

1. **customer** (hopefully, many)

2. **service provider**

3. **continuity factor** that the service provider must guarantee to the service requestor

4. **quality factor** that is

·       _Stipulated through a formal contract_ à Service Level Agreement (SLA) including payments and penalties. SLAs provide a minimum speed, which is very low, and minimum services (provided by day and night, so there are some tricks within these contracts). The providers try to provide the best services in terms of quality, otherwise the clients can change the provider.

·       _Implicit_, but penalties are paid through loss of reputation and trust.

Services and their quality are related to the business core of a company. à The alignment of information technology, business methods and organizational practices influence innovation, productivity, and client satisfaction in service industries. The fundamental principle behind present and future education models is that they should support the transition from a technology delivery approach towards a service delivery approach based on business goals.

(Users don't care about the technologies used to build and provide services. They only care about service quality, characteristics, and business model = how much they must pay for using a service).

Technology is just a means to reach a certain service quality degree.

There are different views of a service:

- Engineering view --> Design, build, test, document, monitor, fix, improve architectures and applications.

- Customer's view --> as we said before, they only want the service to work with a good quality.

**SCALABLE --> COMPLEXITY**

Because we have lots of users that can access our services from all over the world and at any time, we have to build scalable services, which means complex systems, without showing their complexity to the users.

In terms of information:

- every two years we generate the same amount of info from the beginning of history to 2003;

- a week of the New York Times contains more info than a person of the 18th century was to come across in an entire lifetime.

HUMAN MINDS AND PROCESSORS HAVE REACHED THEIR LIMITS: STEPS AHEAD REQUIRE COLLABORATION.

Because of the high concurrency between companies, there is 0 tolerance for unresolved issues. If we are not able to provide a SRS 24/7, there are some consequences:

- loss of prospective customer;

- lost customer;

- lost lives (remember that in a cyberphysical world, you must guarantee security and safety);

- lost reputation.

In terms of speed, there is substantial evidence suggesting that performance and reliability directly impact revenues.

Reliability is a concept based on a collection of practices and cultural lessons that aim to improve service scalability and reliability by holistically incorporating:

·       service architects;

·       software experts developing and testing code;

·       perspective of the users;

·       inevitability of errors and failures;

·       unavoidable changes and expectations of growth.

So, it’s fundamental to understand the impact of reliability metrics, to improve maintenance and incident response, to design and code with a focus on service level objectives and error budgets.

**SERVICES AND BUSINESS GOALS**

We have to set strategies which must be a tradeoff between costs and service levels in context of the impact and requirements for maintaining a reliable and available service. There are two main categories:

·       **business value**;

·       **critical infrastructures** (which are critical for the entire society).

Datacenters are so crucial to e-services that the companies have determined exactly how much they lose whenever there is an outage.

Examples:

- For eBay the loss is about $4,000 per second (120,000$ - 240,000$ per minute)!

- For Amazon the loss is about 150,000$ per minute.

- For Facebook the loss is about 120,000$ per minute.

**In this course we'll consider accidental (internal or external) incidents.**
